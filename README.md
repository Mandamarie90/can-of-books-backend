We will communicate via Slack, or via text messages when Slack fails.
We will breaks as needed, communicated throughout the day.
We will extend hours if possible and contact John or Brandon as needed.

### Cooperative

#### Strengths

##### Jed

- Javascript algorithms
- Code refactoring

##### Amanda

- CSS Styling
- Communication

When developing, the "driver" in the driver-navigator method will be the person most adept at the task at hand.

#### Desired areas of growth

##### Jed 

- Creativity

##### Amanda

-Creativity

In day to day developement, the navigator will ask the driver for clarification on code being written that the driver does not understand.

### Conflict Resolution

Since we will be using the driver navigator method, we will simply communicate when we would like to switch roles to preserve equal contribution.
